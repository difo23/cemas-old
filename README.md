# ESCUELA APP


# Description:

This is a simple project about grade calcifications records for Dominican school. In this case is only the front view of the project.

I build this project just to learn about MERN stack technologies and solve a school problem with my students. With this project I try to teach about teamwork and Scrum. So, students make features of a real project and learn about software development.
